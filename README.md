# Wunder Mobility Challenge Solution

This web application is a response to the Wunder Mobility Challenge, where the goal is to create a user registration web app with a multi-step registration process. The registration process is divided into four distinct steps: personal information, address information, payment information, and a success page. Only one step is displayed to the user at a time, providing a seamless registration experience.

## Technology Stack

- **React + Vite**: For building the user interface efficiently.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS classes and rapid styling.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation and routing within the app.
- **React Query**: For managing data fetching and state.
- **React Hook Form**: For building and handling the registration form.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For managing global state, including the step in the registration process.
- **Framer Motion**: For adding smooth animations and transitions.
- **...and more**: Other libraries and tools used to enhance the application's functionality and user experience.

## Installation and Running the App

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone git@github.com:Grofen/wunder-mobility-challenge.git

# Navigate to the project directory
$ cd wunder-mobility-challenge

# Install project dependencies
$ npm install
